Solution Approach:



Step by step process 

Encoding Advertisements:
Assigning a quantum state (or qubit) to each advertisement slot during the commercial break. The state of the qubit can represent whether an ad is scheduled (|1⟩) or not (|0⟩).

Constraint Implementation:
To ensure that similar advertisement products do not come in a single break, we will introduce a penalty in the quantum Hamiltonian such that if two similar products are scheduled in the same break, the energy of the system (or the cost function) increases.

Optimization:
Using QAOA quantum optimization algorithms, we will  find the lowest energy state (or the minimum of the cost function). This state would represent the optimal advertisement scheduling.

Measurement:
Once the quantum algorithm finds the optimal state, measure the qubits to get the final scheduling of advertisements.



Basically, The solution approach for the TV advertisement scheduling problem is centered around leveraging quantum computing techniques, with a primary focus on the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The goal is to optimize the allocation of advertisements to time slots while adhering to the critical constraints.

Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA): The QAOA is a quantum algorithm designed for optimization tasks. It combines a classical optimization routine with a quantum circuit. In our case, it serves as the core tool for optimizing the advertisement scheduling.

Objective Function: We formulate the optimization problem as a QAOA task. The objective function is designed to minimize the total number of slots used while taking into account the constraint of avoiding product-type conflicts within the same slot. The objective function is constructed in a way that reflects the similarity between advertisements.
