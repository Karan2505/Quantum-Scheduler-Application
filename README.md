Solution Approach:

Step by step process 

Encoding Advertisements:
Assigning a quantum state (or qubit) to each advertisement slot during the commercial break. The state of the qubit can represent whether an ad is scheduled (|1⟩) or not (|0⟩).

Constraint Implementation:
To ensure that similar advertisement products do not come in a single break, we will introduce a penalty in the quantum Hamiltonian such that if two similar products are scheduled in the same break, the energy of the system (or the cost function) increases.

Optimization:
Using QAOA quantum optimization algorithms, we will  find the lowest energy state (or the minimum of the cost function). This state would represent the optimal advertisement scheduling.

Measurement:
Once the quantum algorithm finds the optimal state, measure the qubits to get the final scheduling of advertisements.

Basically, The solution approach for the TV advertisement scheduling problem is centered around leveraging quantum computing techniques, with a primary focus on the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The goal is to optimize the allocation of advertisements to time slots while adhering to the critical constraints.

Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA): The QAOA is a quantum algorithm designed for optimization tasks. It combines a classical optimization routine with a quantum circuit. In our case, it serves as the core tool for optimizing the advertisement scheduling.



Running on Amazon Braket

To execute the quantum optimization for advertisement scheduling, we utilize Amazon Braket, a comprehensive cloud-based quantum computing platform. Below are the steps to set up the environment and run the code:

Amazon Braket Setup: Then, set up an Amazon Braket environment by following the instructions provided in the official Amazon Braket documentation.

Accessing Braket Services: Once your Braket environment is ready, access the services by using your AWS credentials and Braket access key. This step allows you to access and utilize Braket's quantum computing resources.

Executing the Code: With Braket services at your disposal, you can run the Qiskit-based code for the advertisement scheduling problem. Make sure to specify the quantum device or simulator for the execution.

Collecting Results: After execution, collect and analyze the results provided by Amazon Braket. You can gain insights into the optimized advertisement schedule, which adheres to the constraint of product-type separation in slots.



Step by step process:

Set Up Your Environment:
Make sure you have the Amazon Braket Python SDK installed in your Python environment.
Python code: 
pip install amazon-braket-sdk
Import Necessary Libraries:

import numpy as np
from braket.circuits import Circuit
from braket.devices import LocalSimulator
from braket.aws import AwsDevice
from braket.aws import AwsSession
from braket.ocean_plugin import BraketSampler, BraketDWaveSampler

Define Your Problem:
Finding out the no of Qubits required for our optimisation problem. 
And Creating an objective function.

Create a Quantum Circuit:
Using the braket.circuits.Circuit class to build your quantum circuit. Add gates and operations that represent your problem constraints.


Execute the Quantum Circuit:
Python code
# For a local simulato
device = LocalSimulator()

# For an actual quantum device (using AWS credentials)
# aws_session = AwsSession(your_access_key, your_secret_key, your_session_token)
# device = AwsDevice("your_device_arn", aws_session)

# Execute the circuit
task = device.run(circuit, shots=1000)

Retrieve and Analyze Results:
Python code

result = task.result()

Finally we Iterate and Optimize,
Objective Function: We formulate the optimization problem as a QAOA task. The objective function is designed to minimize the total number of slots used while taking into account the constraint of avoiding product-type conflicts within the same slot. The objective function is constructed in a way that reflects the similarity between advertisements.
